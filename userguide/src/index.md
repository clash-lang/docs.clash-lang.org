# Clash Language User Guide

Welcome to the Clash Language User Guide, the official documentation of
the [Clash Compiler](https://clash-lang.org). Clash is an open-source
functional hardware description language (HDL) that borrows syntax and
semantics from the [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) programming
language. To learn more, we suggest reading the
[introduction to Clash](general/index.md).

The table of contents below (and in the sidebar) allows easy access to
different pages in the documentation. You can also use the search
function in the top left corner.

The Clash Compiler and Clash Language User Guide are open-source efforts
developed by QBayLogic B.V. and other volunteers. The Clash Team always
appreciates feedback and contributions to the project to help improve
the development experience.

If you don't understand something, or think something is missing or
incorrect in the documentation you can open an issue or pull request in
the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/clash-lang/clash-compiler).
